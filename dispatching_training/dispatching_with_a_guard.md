order: 12
label: Dispatching with a Guard
---
If there is a Guard active on the train you are dispatching, they will be standing between the middle
and rear of the train by a door.

Again, you must dispatch on the trainâ€™s platform, so position yourself there.

If the train is a single unit (most trains), you must stand from the front to middle of the train and face
backwards towards the Guard (who will be at the rear of the train).

If the train is a double unit (two single unit trains coupled together), the Guard will be positioned in the
middle of the train. In this case, you must stand at the very rear of the train and face forward towards
the Guard, who will be facing backwards toward you.
