Once the train begins loading, click on the light box around it to open
the dispatch GUI on the right hand side of your screen.

**TRTS** stands for **“Train Ready to Start”**. It is a tool used to let any online
Signallers know that the train is preparing to depart the station and the
signal should be changed.

Once the TRTS button appears on your dispatch GUI, **you should press
it as soon as possible** to give the Signaller as much advance notice as
possible.

!!! warning Notice!
Keep in mind that you still must press TRTS right away even if there
are no online Signallers.
