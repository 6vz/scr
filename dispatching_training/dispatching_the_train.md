Do not press the button immediately! First, you must check the

Once it is safe to dispatch, press the “Close Doors” button. You will raise a

After the driver closes the passenger doors,
you must check that all the interlock lights
are unlit. You are allowed to move around or
zoom out to do so, but keep it quick while
making sure to check all of them.

The interlock lights are the small, orange
lights on each carriage of the train. There is
always at least one per carriage. Their
appearance varies across trains.

Once you have checked all the interlock
lights and the signal is still clear, press the
“Dispatch” button to release the train. You
will again whistle and raise a bat. Do not
leave the platform until the train has safely
exited the station.
