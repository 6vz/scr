Once you spawn, it is **YOUR** responsibility to dispatch every
train that stops on these platforms until you despawn.
Therefore, it is important that you keep a close eye to see
whenever a train arrives.

If you fail to dispatch a train, a person might report you for not co-operating, and you (most likely) will get demoted
