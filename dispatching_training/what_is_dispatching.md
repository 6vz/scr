label: What is Dispatching?
order: 20
--- 
Dispatching is the process by which Dispatchers and/or Guards safely and efficiently send a train out
from a station. Once a train arrives, it loads; the Dispatcher, if present, lets any online Signallers know
that the train is ready to depart; and the train is released from the station to drive to its next stop
through a series of steps which vary based on the presence of a Dispatcher and/or Guard.

### Unlocking Dispatcher role in-game
The Dispatcher role in-game is only unlocked for members who have the Dispatcher rank (or a higher
rank). To obtain the Dispatcher rank, a Qualified Driver must attend and pass a Dispatcher training after
earning 360 experience. The training consists of a briefing, demonstration, Q&A, and assessment.
