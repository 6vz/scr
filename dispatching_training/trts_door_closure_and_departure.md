order: 11
label: TRTS, Door Closure, and Departure
---
Just as before, you should press TRTS as soon as it appears on your
dispatch GUI.

When the train finishes loading, the Close Doors button will appear. If the
signal is clear, press this button so the Guard can close the doors.

Again, check that all the interlock lights are off. This time, the interlock
light for the Guardâ€™s local carriage will remain on. That is okay.

Once you have checked the interlock lights and the signal is still clear,
press the Dispatch button. The Guard will respond by holding up a green
torch. They will then enter the train and complete a series of actions
before the train departs.
