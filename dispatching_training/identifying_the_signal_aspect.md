label: Identifying the Signal Aspect
---
After you press TRTS, any online Signallers
controlling your dispatch station will change the
signal if necessary as soon as possible. There are
several ways you can determine if you can
dispatch safely based on the signal aspect.

You can determine the aspect of the signal at
your platform by looking at the physical signal
itself.

As mentioned in Qualified Driver training, a red
signal means Danger, a yellow signal means
Caution, a double yellow signal means
Preliminary Caution, and a green signal means
Proceed. There are a few other types of signal
aspects, but they are not important for
dispatching.

!!! info If you dont know these...
I recommend you checking out signals at `QD Training tab` > [`Signal Aspects`](/driver_training/signal_aspects/)
<br>It is recommended, to do a Fast revision, before going further
!!!

Another way to determine the signal aspect ahead is with a
tool called an OFF Indicator. OFF Indicators are the most
commonly used tool to identify the signal aspect when
dispatching or guarding.

A lit OFF indicator means the signal ahead is
Proceed/Caution/Preliminary Caution, and it is safe to
dispatch.

An unlit OFF indicator means the signal ahead is Danger,
and it is not safe to dispatch.
