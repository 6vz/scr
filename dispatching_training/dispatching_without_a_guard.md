label: Dispatching without a Guard
order: 17
---
The dispatch procedure varies depending on whether or not there is a Guard active on the train you
are dispatching. If there is no Guard (who would be positioned from the rear to middle of the train),
then you must follow this procedure while dispatching.

Once you spawn, head to the platform on which the train has arrived. **You must dispatch from this
platform**, unless dispatching on an adjacent island platform would improve visibility with the driver,
such as when there is a curved platform like at Stepford High Street.

**You must stand from the middle to rear of the train when dispatching without a Guard.** There are
no exceptions. Make sure to stand a safe distance from the train.

**You must also face towards the front of the train, where the driver is positioned, while dispatching
without a Guard.** Again, there are no exceptions. The driver should be able to see your dispatch bat.
