label: Driving with a Guard
order: 9
---
The driving procedure varies slightly, depending on whether or not there is
Guard on your train.

When you accept a guard request, your guard is teleported to a seat inside
your train. When you come to a stop, you need to enable your doors to
allow the guard to stand up and begin their procedure. They will now be
leaving your train and open the passenger doors to start the process of
loading passengers.

Once passengers have been loaded, you have to wait for the guard to
sound their whistle and close the doors again. Next, they will check that all
doors have been closed. If the signal ahead is clear, they will sound their
whistle a second time and get back into your train.

Now you can see that the loading bar says “Awaiting guard buzzer...”. Before
you can depart, the guard needs to press the buzzer to let you know that
everything is ready for departure. You will hear an audible tone and have a
bell icon flash in your GUI too. All you have to do, is buzz the guard back by
either clicking on the bell in the GUI or simply pressing “T”. After this, you
are allowed to depart the station.
