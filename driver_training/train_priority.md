When you arrive at a station with a Dispatcher, they have to follow a train priority which is one of their rules.
Please be patient if you aren’t dispatched first, as this may be the reason why.

The most basic priority rule is the so called “Headcode Priority” where the Dispatcher will look at the first digit of
your headcode to figure out how high your priority is compared to other trains at the station.

Trains with a headcode will receive the highest priority, followed by , and having the
lowest priority of all.

If you are late, it does not automatically mean that you receive the highest priority either.

For example: A late 1X## train will have priority over a `1X##` service that is on time, but does not have priority
over any `9X##` service due to the so called “headcode priority” that was just mentioned.
