!!! warning Numbered car stop markers have priority over S car stop markers.
If
there is no car stop marker that corresponds to the amount of coaches
of your train, stop at the next higher number instead. If there are no
numbered markers, stop at the S car stop marker.
!!!

When your arrived at the terminus with your train, you should stop
close to the buffer (if present) or at the designated car marker which
may be labeled as “Terminating Car Stop”.

You will notice that not all car markers have the same colour either. The
black markers are universal and used for all operators, whereas a light
blue marker is for Connect and an orange marker for Airlink only.
