A headcode is a unique identifier for your train and is used for
communication between Drivers, Dispatchers, Guards and
Signallers.

The headcode consists of the following parts:
- A single-digit number, indicating the train class (`a type of service`)
- A letter, indicating the destination of the train
- A two-digit number, generated between 00 and 98
(in sequential order)

Every train has a different headcode. For example, if there are two
trains driving from Stepford Victoria to Stepford UFC, both of their
headcodes will start with “2U” but will end with a different
two-digit number to make them distinguishable from each other.
