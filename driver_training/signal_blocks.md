label: Signal Blocks
order: 11
---
Every route is broken up into smaller sections that
are referred to as “block”, which is the area between
two signals.
Each block is big enough to allow for an entire train
to stop within one.
These blocks are used to ensure a safe and efficient
operation of the trains.
Only one train at a time is allowed to occupy a block,
to prevent any crashes.
