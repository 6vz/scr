All throughout the rail network of SCR, you will encounter many
different signs that will help you to operate your train in a safe
manner.

The “Speed Indicator” is the most common sign you will find whilst
driving a train. The number on the sign indicates the speed you
should pass it at until the next speed indicator. Your GUI will also show
you this speed limit underneath your current speed.

The “Warning Indicator” is also a type of speed sign. However, this one
alerts you to an upcoming change of the speed limit. When passing
this sign, you should start to slow down to the speed that is shown on
it.

The “Whistle Board” is usually found before level crossings or hidden
junctions. When passing this sign, you should sound your horn to alert
potential pedestrians and oncoming trains that may not see you.
