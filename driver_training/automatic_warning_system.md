label: Automatic warning System

The “Automatic Warning System”, also referred to as “AWS”, will remind you
with a visual indicator and audible tone that you are approaching a signal
that is set to Caution/Danger.

You have 6 seconds to dismiss the AWS warning by clicking directly on it in
the GUI or pressing “Q” on your keyboard.

If you don’t dismiss this warning, you train will come to an immediate halt
and you have to wait 10 seconds before you can release the brakes.

Similarly, if you pass a signal at danger (SPAD - Signal passed at Danger),
the TPWS (Train Protection & Warning System) will engage the emergency
brakes and your train will come to an immediate halt and you have to wait
20 seconds before being able to release your brakes.

If this signal is controlled by a signaller, you have to wait for them to change
the signal to caution/proceed before you can release your brakes.
