label: Signal Aspects
order: 11

Just like cars, trains also have traffic lights which we refer to as
“Signals”. To avoid trains from crashing into each other or
accidently SPADing, you need to understand what each signal
represents and what you should do when you see them.

+++ Green
A green signal means that the block ahead is clear and that you
can pass this signal at the speed limit. The next signal may be
green or double yellow.

+++ Double Yellow
A double yellow signal means that the block ahead is clear, but
you should start to slow down in preparation of the upcoming
Caution signal.

+++ Yellow
A yellow signal means that the block ahead is clear, but you should
slow down to 45 MPH until the next green aspect.

+++ Red
A red signal means that the block ahead is occupied by another
train or is being controlled by a signaller (indicated by a blue dot
on the signal). Stop in front of the signal and wait until the aspect
changes to yellow or green to proceed.

+++ Shunt Signals
At depots and sidings you can find so called “Shunt Signals” on the
ground. White means you can proceed at the speed limit and red
means the block ahead is occupied and you need to stop.
