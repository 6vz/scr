label: Interacting with a Dispatcher
order: 10
---
The driving procedure varies slightly, depending on whether or not there is
a Dispatcher on the platform you are stopping at.

When you arrive at a station and finish loading your passengers, you will
notice that you are unable to close your doors if there is a Dispatcher on
duty. Instead, you will see “Awaiting doors dispatch...” above your GUI.

You will have to wait for the dispatcher to come to your platform and
dispatch your train. They will sound their whistle, after which you are able to
close your doors. When this has been done, you will then see “Awaiting
final dispatch...” above your GUI.

Finally, after the Dispatcher sounds their whistle for a second time, you will
be allowed to depart the station and be on your way.
